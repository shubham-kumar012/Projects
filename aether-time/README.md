## How It Works
- Start button triggers the setInterval() to update time every 10ms.

- Stop button clears the interval to pause the stopwatch.

- Reset button sets all values to zero and stops the timer.

- Time is calculated and updated by tracking milliseconds, seconds, and minutes using JavaScript.

## Concepts Used
- setInterval() and clearInterval() and Date.now()

- DOM manipulation (document.getElementById, innerText)

- CSS Flexbox for layout

- Event listeners for button controls
