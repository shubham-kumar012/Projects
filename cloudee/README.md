# â›…Cloudee - Weather Web App

This is a simple and responsive weather web app that I built using ***HTML***, ***CSS***, and ***JavaScript***. It shows real-time weather updates by fetching data from the OpenWeather API, with the help of ***Axios*** for API requests. The design is clean, user-friendly, and looks good on all screen sizes â€” inspired by a layout I first created in Figma.
