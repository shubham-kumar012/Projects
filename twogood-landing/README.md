#  TwoGoodCo. Website Clone

This is a **fully responsive front-end clone** of the TwoGoodCo. website, built as a practice project to improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.  
It replicates the original layout, smooth interactions, and animations using modern front-end tools like **Locomotive Scroll**, **GSAP**, and **ScrollTrigger**
